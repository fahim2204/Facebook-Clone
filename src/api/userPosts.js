It took the BBC Natural History Unit (NHU) four and a half years of filming across 18 different countries to produce the six-part series.The result, Sir David Attenborough reveals in the opening sequence, captures \"natural phenomena never before seen by humans\". The success of the series in revealing new animal behaviour has already led to one scientific publication on the Lapland bumble bee - with more expected to follow.",

        "text":"The Unix epoch (or Unix time or POSIX time or Unix timestamp) is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap seconds (in ISO 8601: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Literally speaking the epoch is Unix time 0 (midnight 1/1/1970), but 'epoch' is often used as a synonym for Unix time. Some systems store epoch dates as a signed 32-bit integer, which might cause problems on January 19, 2038 (known as the Year 2038 problem or Y2038). The converter on this page converts timestamps in seconds (10-digit), milliseconds (13-digit) and microseconds (16-digit) to readable dates.",
